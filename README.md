# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- I have developed an Employee Task Manager using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. This application is designed to streamline task assignment and tracking within an organization. It features two main user roles: Admin and Employee. The Admin can create, assign, and manage tasks, while Employees can view and update the status of the tasks assigned to them. The interface is clean and responsive, built with Tailwind for modern UI styling, ensuring a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive web applications and manage user roles and data flow effectively using modern frontend technologies.
